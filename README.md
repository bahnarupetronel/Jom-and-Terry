# Jom-and-Terry
Jom and Terry is a project made in C in which we implemented a competing server (TCP type) that accepts a maximum of 4 pairs of clients and sends them messages every 3 seconds if they meet or condition. If a Terry customer logs in first, then he will receive a magic ball, otherwise he will receive a Jom customer. The customer who owns the magic ball will send a warning message every 3 seconds (via the server) to all other customers. The message will be ignored by customers who also have the magic ball. If a customer receives a warning message three times, they will be disconnected.
